youth authority

i'm old, i know.

moldy wino, righto...now!

i was aware during my mother's labors, it was a shared event. 

generations of racism, sexism, social shism haven't touched on another boundary: agism.

my first memory was of water, sitting bolt upright, hearing the ocean. or grabbing my right foot and evacuating my bowels at the same time.

so teach me how to think.

i'd settle for why, even.

two sticks stuck together, or a split in a branch, causes the limb to tremble over a underwater reservoir. why?

because they are competing to provide for each other....

enough zen, we want full circles!
